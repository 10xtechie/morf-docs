# Morf Getting Started Guide

## What is Morf?

Morf is a modern and lightweight API-driven platform that offers a rapid and flexible approach to form and document generation.   Morf enables your organization to overcome the scale of digital transformation by automating the conversion, creation, and maintenance of your forms and documents.  Using Morf, you can quickly create mobile-ready web forms and tie them into your document generation and electronic signature workflows.

## The Morf Difference

Instead of trying create yet another drag and drop form editor, Morf allows you to quickly define you form with a simple declarative syntax.  The editor provides tyep-ahead hints and real-time form preview.  Better yet, Morf converts your existing forms and documents into the form definition and creates the corresponding data bindins. Within mere minutes, you can start collecting data that flows into dynamic signature-ready documents and into any backend system of record.  

## Creating Morf Forms

To create your first Morf form, navigate to https://editor.getmorf.io/.  In the left-hand panel, you can edit the form defintion.   
The definition consists of 3 main parts: 
<ul>
  <li>config</li>
  <li>head</li>
  <li>body</li>  
</ul>

The config section contains configurations that affect the whole form, such as the submission endpoint or theme to style the form.
